About Horiseon Accessibility and SEO Optimization

The purpose of this project was to  increase traffic to the site by allowing it to score higher on its ability to be accessible to all users, and make the HTML semantic and easy to follow for anybody who looks at this code in the future. It is included with notes with several of the changes made to allow users a complete understanding of how the code works, and how it relates to what people see on the webpage itself. 

In order to score higher on Search Engine Optimization (SEO) scores, each image has an alternate tag for those who are vision impaired. Because we also added a descriptive title to the page (rather than "title") end users can easily navigate to the page when they have multiple tags open. 

Several CSS elements were consolidated so that future viewers will be able to understand what is going on in the code quicker than before.

Here are key screenshots of the CSS and HTML code:
